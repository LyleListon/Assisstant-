# Context Window Management Strategy

## Challenge
- Claude's context window is limited to 200,000 tokens
- Context gets filled up during development/interaction
- New assistant instances lose previous context
- Need to maintain continuity across sessions

## Solution Strategy

### 1. State Persistence
```python
class ContextState:
    """Maintains critical state information between sessions"""
    def __init__(self):
        self.current_phase = None
        self.completed_tasks = []
        self.pending_tasks = []
        self.last_modification = None
        self.active_features = {}
```

### 2. Development Checkpoints
- Create clear, documented stopping points
- Each major feature should be self-contained
- Store progress markers in state file
- Include "next steps" in documentation

### 3. Documentation Structure
```
/docs
    /checkpoints/
        - checkpoint_001.md  # Initial setup
        - checkpoint_002.md  # Core features
        - checkpoint_003.md  # Extensions
    /features/
        - feature_001.md    # Feature documentation
        - feature_002.md    # Each feature self-contained
    /progress/
        - current_state.md  # Latest state
        - next_steps.md     # Next tasks
```

### 4. State File Format
```json
{
    "checkpoint": "003",
    "last_completed": "2024-01-20T15:30:00",
    "current_state": {
        "phase": "core_implementation",
        "active_features": ["file_ops", "command_exec"],
        "pending_features": ["browser_control", "search"]
    },
    "next_steps": [
        "Implement browser control enhancement",
        "Add search functionality",
        "Test integration"
    ]
}
```

### 5. Resumption Protocol
1. Load state file
2. Read latest checkpoint
3. Review completed features
4. Check pending tasks
5. Resume development

### 6. Feature Implementation Strategy
- Each feature must be:
  * Self-contained
  * Well-documented
  * Independently testable
  * State-aware
  * Easily resumable

### 7. Code Organization
```python
# Each feature module includes state management
class Feature:
    def __init__(self):
        self.state = self.load_state()
        
    def save_state(self):
        """Save feature state to disk"""
        pass
        
    def load_state(self):
        """Load feature state from disk"""
        pass
        
    def get_status(self):
        """Return feature status for documentation"""
        pass
```

### 8. Documentation Guidelines
1. Keep each document focused and concise
2. Use clear section markers
3. Include status indicators
4. Maintain "next steps" section
5. Document dependencies clearly

### 9. Progress Tracking
```python
class ProgressTracker:
    """Tracks development progress across sessions"""
    
    def save_checkpoint(self):
        """Save development checkpoint"""
        pass
        
    def load_checkpoint(self):
        """Load last checkpoint"""
        pass
        
    def generate_status_report(self):
        """Create status report for documentation"""
        pass
```

### 10. Implementation Priority
1. Core state management
2. Documentation system
3. Progress tracking
4. Feature framework
5. Testing framework

## Best Practices
1. Commit often with clear messages
2. Update state file after each major change
3. Document decisions and rationale
4. Keep feature modules independent
5. Regular checkpoint creation

## Next Steps
1. Implement state management system
2. Create initial checkpoint
3. Set up documentation structure
4. Begin core feature implementation
5. Establish testing framework

This strategy ensures smooth continuation of development across multiple sessions and different Claude instances.
