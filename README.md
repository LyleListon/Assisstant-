# Personal Assistant

A modular personal assistant system designed with independence and scalability in mind. Each module operates independently with minimal cross-module dependencies, making the system easy to maintain and extend.

## Architecture

The system follows a modular architecture with:

- **Core Dispatcher**: Routes requests between independent modules
- **Independent Modules**: Each handling specific functionality
- **Message-based Communication**: Clean, typed interfaces between components
- **State Management**: Each module manages its own state

### Current Modules

- **File Operations**: Handles all file-related tasks
- **Core Dispatcher**: Routes messages between modules

### Planned Modules

- Command Execution: System command handling
- Browser Control: Web interaction capabilities
- Search: File and content search functionality
