# Challenges and Advantages Analysis

## Potential Challenges

### 1. Context Window Management
- **Challenge**: 200k token limit means we can't hold entire codebase in memory
- **Impact**: Could miss important file relationships or dependencies
- **Risk**: Might recreate existing functionality unknowingly
- **Mitigation Ideas**:
  * Create detailed module interface documentation
  * Maintain a "project state" file that summarizes all modules
  * Use clear naming conventions to indicate relationships

### 2. Module Independence vs. Duplication
- **Challenge**: Keeping modules independent could lead to code duplication
- **Impact**: Maintenance overhead, inconsistent implementations
- **Risk**: Different modules solving same problems differently
- **Mitigation Ideas**:
  * Create minimal shared utilities
  * Document common patterns
  * Regular code review for duplication

### 3. State Management Across Sessions
- **Challenge**: Maintaining project continuity between Claude sessions
- **Impact**: Could lose development context or decision history
- **Risk**: Inconsistent development direction
- **Mitigation Ideas**:
  * Detailed checkpoint documentation
  * Clear "last state" and "next steps" records
  * Decision log for major architectural choices

### 4. Communication Overhead
- **Challenge**: Ensuring clear understanding between user and assistant
- **Impact**: Could lead to misaligned development
- **Risk**: Wasted effort on unnecessary features
- **Mitigation Ideas**:
  * Regular check-ins before code changes
  * Clear documentation of assumptions
  * Step-by-step development validation

## Advantages to Leverage

### 1. Modular Architecture Benefits
- **Advantage**: Each module can be developed and tested independently
- **Opportunity**: Perfect for context-limited development
- **Benefits**:
  * Can focus on one module at a time
  * Easy to verify functionality
  * Simple to document

### 2. Documentation-First Approach
- **Advantage**: Forces clear thinking before implementation
- **Opportunity**: Creates self-contained knowledge base
- **Benefits**:
  * Easy to resume development
  * Clear project history
  * Reduced communication errors

### 3. Iterative Development
- **Advantage**: Can validate each step before proceeding
- **Opportunity**: Catch issues early
- **Benefits**:
  * Reduced rework
  * Better alignment with requirements
  * Easier to maintain quality

### 4. Clear Boundaries
- **Advantage**: Forced separation of concerns
- **Opportunity**: Natural testing boundaries
- **Benefits**:
  * Easy to understand
  * Simple to maintain
  * Clear responsibility allocation

## Strategic Recommendations

### 1. Development Process
1. Document module interface before coding
2. Validate interface with user
3. Implement minimal version
4. Test independently
5. Document state before context switch

### 2. Documentation Strategy
1. Keep module docs with code
2. Maintain central project state
3. Log all major decisions
4. Clear next steps at all times

### 3. Testing Approach
1. Test modules in isolation
2. Document test scenarios
3. Maintain test data
4. Clear success criteria

### 4. Communication Protocol
1. Check-in before new code
2. Validate assumptions
3. Clear status updates
4. Regular progress review
